//Two positive integers N and M are given. Integer N represents the number of chocolates arranged in a circle, numbered from 0 to N − 1.
//You start to eat the chocolates. After eating a chocolate you leave only a wrapper.
//You begin with eating chocolate number 0. Then you omit the next M − 1 chocolates or wrappers on the circle, and eat the following one.
//More precisely, if you ate chocolate number X, then you will next eat the chocolate with number (X + M) modulo N (remainder of division).
//You stop eating when you encounter an empty wrapper.
//For example, given integers N = 10 and M = 4. You will eat the following chocolates: 0, 4, 8, 2, 6.
//The goal is to count the number of chocolates that you will eat, following the above rules.
//Write a function:
//object Solution { def solution(N: Int, M: Int): Int }
//that, given two positive integers N and M, returns the number of chocolates that you will eat.
//For example, given integers N = 10 and M = 4. the function should return 5, as explained above.
//Assume that:
//N and M are integers within the range [1..1,000,000,000].
//Complexity:
//expected worst-case time complexity is O(log(N+M));
//expected worst-case space complexity is O(1).

//When we met with an empty wrapper, we must have been this position for twice.
//We use i for the first time and j for the second time. Due to the modulo feature,
//there must be nature number, to say k, so that: i * M + k * N = j * M.
//Then we could easily prove that the smallest (earliest) i must be zero (for all i != 0,
//    then (i-i) * M + k * N = (j-i) * M ).
//    So the first eaten position would be first position that you meet again.
//    Finally, the j would be the number of chocolates that you will eat.
