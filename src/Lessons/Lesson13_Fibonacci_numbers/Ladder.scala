//You have to climb up a ladder. The ladder has exactly N rungs, numbered from 1 to N. With each step, you can ascend by one or two rungs. More precisely:
//with your first step you can stand on rung 1 or 2,
//if you are on rung K, you can move to rungs K + 1 or K + 2,
//finally you have to stand on rung N.
//Your task is to count the number of different ways of climbing to the top of the ladder.
//For example, given N = 4, you have five different ways of climbing, ascending by:
//1, 1, 1 and 1 rung,
//1, 1 and 2 rungs,
//1, 2 and 1 rung,
//2, 1 and 1 rungs, and
//2 and 2 rungs.
//Given N = 5, you have eight different ways of climbing, ascending by:
//1, 1, 1, 1 and 1 rung,
//1, 1, 1 and 2 rungs,
//1, 1, 2 and 1 rung,
//1, 2, 1 and 1 rung,
//1, 2 and 2 rungs,
//2, 1, 1 and 1 rungs,
//2, 1 and 2 rungs, and
//2, 2 and 1 rung.
//The number of different ways can be very large, so it is sufficient to return the result modulo 2P, for a given integer P.
//Write a function:
//object Solution { def solution(A: Array[Int], B: Array[Int]): Array[Int] }
//that, given two non-empty zero-indexed arrays A and B of L integers, returns an array consisting of L integers specifying the consecutive answers; position I should contain the number of different ways of climbing the ladder with A[I] rungs modulo 2B[I].
//For example, given L = 5 and:
//    A[0] = 4   B[0] = 3
//    A[1] = 4   B[1] = 2
//    A[2] = 5   B[2] = 4
//    A[3] = 5   B[3] = 3
//    A[4] = 1   B[4] = 1
//the function should return the sequence [5, 1, 8, 0, 1], as explained above.
//Assume that:
//L is an integer within the range [1..30,000];
//each element of array A is an integer within the range [1..L];
//each element of array B is an integer within the range [1..30].
//Complexity:
//expected worst-case time complexity is O(L);
//expected worst-case space complexity is O(L), beyond input storage (not counting the storage required for input arguments).
//Elements of input arrays can be modified.
