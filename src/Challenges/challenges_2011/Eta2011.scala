//An island has M towns: M ≥ 4 and M is an even integer. The towns are labelled with unique integers within the range [0..(M−1)]. The towns are connected through a network of (M−1) roads. Each road is bidirectional and connects exactly two distinct towns. Some towns, called cul-de-sacs, are connected to just one other town. Each of the remaining towns is connected to exactly three other towns. Each town can be reached from any other town.
//Last year, the queen of the island went on a trip to visit all the towns (eventually arriving back at the starting point). She took a route that passed through each of (M−1) roads exactly twice. The sequence of towns visited during this trip was logged. Each cul-de-sac town was visited exactly once. Every other town had to be visited exactly three times (the final arrival at the starting point was not counted as a visit).
//After last year's trip, the queen ordered the construction of a new circular highway connecting all cul-de-sac towns. The highway consists of a number of new roads, connecting the cul-de-sacs in the order of the queen's last visit.
//The idea was raised that, with the new roads in place, it may be possible to devise a Hamiltonian route this year; i.e. one that passes through each town exactly once (and arrives back at the starting point).
//Write a function
//object Solution { def solution(A: Array[Int]): Int }
//that, given a zero-indexed array A consisting of N = 2*(M−1) integers representing the sequence in which M towns were visited last year, returns the number of different Hamiltonian routes possible this year.
//The function should return 0 if no Hamiltonian route exists.
//The function should return −1 if the number of possible Hamiltonian routes exceeds 100,000,000.
//The function should return −2 if the route described by the array A violates any of the following conditions:
//each road connects distinct towns;
//each town is visited either exactly once or exactly thrice;
//each road is taken exactly twice.
//Assume that:
//N = 2*(M−1), where M is an even integer within the range [4..200,000];
//each element of the array A is an integer within the range [0..(M−1)].
//Two Hamiltonian routes that contain exactly the same roads are considered the same, and are counted as one. For example, a route that goes through 0, 3, 4, 1, 5, 6, 7, 2 (and back to 0) is the same as the route 3, 4, 1, 5, 6, 7, 2, 0 (and back to 3), and is the same as the route 0, 2, 7, 6, 5, 1, 4, 3 (and back to 0).
//For example, consider array A consisting of fourteen elements such that:
//A[0]  = 4  A[1]  = 0  A[2]  = 4
//A[3]  = 3  A[4]  = 4  A[5]  = 1
//A[6]  = 5  A[7]  = 1  A[8]  = 7
//A[9]  = 6  A[10] = 7  A[11] = 2
//A[12] = 7  A[13] = 1
//Given this array, the function should return 3, as explained below.
//The left picture below shows the road network inferred from the sequence A, and the right picture shows the new circular highway that runs through the cul-de-sacs:
//
//Exactly three distinct Hamiltonian routes are possible:
//
//Taking another example, for the following array A:
//A[0]  = 4  A[1]  = 4  A[2]  = 0
//A[3]  = 3  A[4]  = 4  A[5]  = 1
//A[6]  = 5  A[7]  = 1  A[8]  = 7
//A[9]  = 6  A[10] = 7  A[11] = 2
//A[12] = 7  A[13] = 1
//the function should return −2, because the first road in the route does not connect distinct towns (it connects town 4 with itself).
//Taking another example, for the following array A:
//A[0]  = 3  A[1]  = 6  A[2]  = 3
//A[3]  = 1  A[4]  = 5  A[5]  = 1
//A[6]  = 0  A[7]  = 1  A[8]  = 3
//A[9]  = 7  A[10] = 3  A[11] = 2
//A[12] = 3  A[13] = 4
//the function should return −2, because the given route violates the condition regarding towns (town 3 is visited neither exactly once, nor exactly thrice).
//Taking another example, for the following sequence A:
//A[0] = 4  A[1] = 0  A[2] = 5
//A[3] = 0  A[4] = 3  A[5] = 0
//A[6] = 1  A[7] = 3  A[8] = 2
//A[9] = 3
//the function should return −2, because the given route violates the condition regarding roads: the road connecting towns 0 and 3 occurs twice as it should (it is first taken in the direction from 0 to 3, then from 3 to 0), but the road connecting towns 0 and 1 (and few other roads) incorrectly occurs only once.
//Complexity:
//expected worst-case time complexity is O(N);
//expected worst-case space complexity is O(N), beyond input storage (not counting the storage required for input arguments).
//Elements of input arrays can be modified.
