//The median of a sequence of numbers X[0], X[1], ..., X[N] is the middle element in terms of their values. More formally, the median of X[0], X[1], ..., X[N] is an element X[I] of the sequence, such that at most half of the elements are larger than X[I] and at most half of the elements are smaller than X[I]. For example, the median of the following sequence:
//  X[0] = 7    X[1] = 2    X[2] = 5    X[3] = 2    X[4] = 8
//is 5; the median of the following sequence:
//  X[0] = 2    X[1] = 2    X[2] = 5    X[3] = 2
//is 2; and the following sequence:
//  X[0] = 1    X[1] = 5    X[2] = 7
//  X[3] = 4    X[4] = 2    X[5] = 8
//has two medians: 4 and 5.
//Note that sequences of odd length have only one median, which is equal to X[N/2] after sorting X. In this problem we consider medians of sequences of odd length only.
//Write a function:
//object Solution { def solution(A: Array[Int], B: Array[Int], P: Array[Int], Q: Array[Int], R: Array[Int], S: Array[Int]): Int }
//that, given:
//two non-empty zero-indexed arrays, A (consisting of N integers) and B (consisting of M integers), both sorted in ascending order
//two zero-indexed arrays P and Q, each consisting of K indices of array A, such that 0 ≤ P[I] ≤ Q[I] < N for 0 ≤ I < K
//two zero-indexed arrays R and S, each consisting of K indices of array B, such that 0 ≤ R[I] ≤ S[I] < M for 0 ≤ I < K
//computes medians of K sequences of the form:
//  A[P[I]], A[P[I]+1], ..., A[Q[I]-1], A[Q[I]], B[R[I]], B[R[I]+1], ..., B[S[I]-1], B[S[I]]
//for 0 ≤ I < K, and returns the median of all such medians.
//For example, given the following arrays:
//  A[0] = -2   A[1] = 4    A[2] = 10   A[3] = 13
//  B[0] = 5    B[1] = 6    B[2] = 8    B[3] = 12    B[4] = 13
//  P[0] = 2    P[1] = 1    P[2] = 0
//  Q[0] = 3    Q[1] = 2    Q[2] = 3
//  R[0] = 0    R[1] = 0    R[2] = 1
//  S[0] = 4    S[1] = 0    S[2] = 3
//the function should return 8, since:
//the median of [10, 13, 5, 6, 8, 12, 13] equals 10,
//the median of [4, 10, 5] equals 5,
//the median of [−2, 4, 10, 13, 6, 8, 12] equals 8, and
//the median of [10, 5, 8] equals 8.
//Assume that:
//N and M are integers within the range [1..100,000];
//K is an integer within the range [1..10,000];
//each element of arrays A, B is an integer within the range [−1,000,000,000..1,000,000,000];
//array A is sorted in non-decreasing order;
//array B is sorted in non-decreasing order;
//each element of arrays P, Q is an integer within the range [0..N−1];
//each element of arrays R, S is an integer within the range [0..M−1];
//P[i] ≤ Q[i] and R[i] ≤ S[i] for 0 ≤ i < K;
//K is odd and so is Q[i]−P[i]+R[i]−S[i] for 0 ≤ i < K.
//Complexity:
//expected worst-case time complexity is O(K*log(K+N+M));
//expected worst-case space complexity is O(K), beyond input storage (not counting the storage required for input arguments).
//Elements of input arrays can be modified.
