//A positive integer N is given. Consider the sequence of numbers [0, 1, ..., N]. What is the total number of zeros in the decimal representations of these numbers?
//N can be very large. Hence, it is given in the form of a non-empty string S of length L, containing a decimal representation of N. S contains no leading zeros.
//Write a function:
//object Solution { def solution(S: String): Int }
//that, given a string S, which is a decimal representation of some positive integer N, returns the total number of zeros in the decimal representations of numbers [0, 1, ..., N]. If the result exceeds 1,410,000,016, the function should return the remainder from the division of the result by 1,410,000,017.
//For example, for S="100" the function should return 12 and for S="219" it should return 42.
//Assume that:
//L is an integer within the range [1..10,000];
//string S consists only of digits (0âˆ’9);
//string S contains no leading zeros.
//Complexity:
//expected worst-case time complexity is O(L);
//expected worst-case space complexity is O(L) (not counting the storage required for input arguments).
