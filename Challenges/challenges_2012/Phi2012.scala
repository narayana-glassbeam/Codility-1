//A board consisting of squares arranged into N rows and M columns is given. A tiling of this board is a pattern of tiles that covers it. A tiling is interesting if:
//only tiles of size 1x1 and/or 2x2 are used;
//each tile of size 1x1 covers exactly one whole square;
//each tile of size 2x2 covers exactly four whole squares;
//each square of the board is covered by exactly one tile.
//For example, the following images show a few interesting tilings of a board of size 4 rows and 3 columns:
//
//Two interesting tilings of a board are different if there exists at least one square on the board that is covered with a tile of size 1x1 in one tiling and with a tile of size 2x2 in the other. For example, all tilings shown in the images above are different.
//Write a function:
//object Solution { def solution(N: Int, M: Int): Int }
//that, given two integers N and M, returns the remainder modulo 10,000,007 of the number of different interesting tilings of a board of size N rows and M columns.
//For example, given N = 4 and M = 3, the function should return 11, because there are 11 different interesting tilings of a board of size 4 rows and 3 columns:
//
//Assume that:
//N is an integer within the range [1..1,000,000];
//M is an integer within the range [1..7].
//Complexity:
//expected worst-case time complexity is O(log(N)*8M);
//expected worst-case space complexity is O(4M).
