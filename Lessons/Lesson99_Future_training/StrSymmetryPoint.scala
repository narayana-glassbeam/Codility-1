//Write a function:
//object Solution { def solution(S: String): Int }
//that, given a string S, returns the index (counting from 0) of a character such that the part of the string to the left of that character is a reversal of the part of the string to its right. The function should return âˆ’1 if no such index exists.
//Note: reversing an empty string (i.e. a string whose length is zero) gives an empty string.
//For example, given a string:
//"racecar"
//the function should return 3, because the substring to the left of the character "e" at index 3 is "rac", and the one to the right is "car".
//Given a string:
//"x"
//the function should return 0, because both substrings are empty.
//Assume that:
//the length of S is within the range [0..2,000,000].
//Complexity:
//expected worst-case time complexity is O(length(S));
//expected worst-case space complexity is O(1) (not counting the storage required for input arguments).
